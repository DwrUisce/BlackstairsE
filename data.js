This system serves as a showcase of the potential for recovering electricity from existing water supply pipes instead of just dissipating it by means of a throttling valve. Here at Blackstairs, water is abstracted from a river intake at a higher elevation and is carried via a 2 km pipeline up to the raw water tank on top of which you are currently located.</div><div>Due to the altitude difference between the river intake and the tank, water traveling by gravity produces an excess pressure which is used to drive the turbine and generate power.</div><div><br></div><div>To proceed with the tour, please make your way to either the turbine floor, the control room or the river intake scenes by clicking on the ^ signs. Click and drag your mouse button to view the whole scene.</div><div><br></div><div>This project is a collaboration between Bangor University, Trinity College Dublin, and Blackstairs Group Water Scheme. It was made possible due to the support the ERDF Interreg Ireland-Wales Programme 2014-2020, through the DÅµr Uisce Project.</div>"
